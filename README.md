# Kicad

Kicad symbols for Amstrad CPC custom ICs and some related devices.
==================================================================

These ICs were used in the Amstrad CPC464, CPC664, CPC472 and CPC6128.

NOTE: While I have taken every precaution to verify the accuracy of the data contained in this repository these symbols have not been verified against original hardware.

Included symbols:

40007/40008 Gate array. These both have the same the same pinout and function but the latter is a revised design which doesn't need a heatsink.

40010 Gate array. This functions the same as the 40007 but has a different pinout.

40030 PAL/HAL. This is the memory manager used in the Amstrad CPC6128

AY-3-8910 Programmable Sound Generator. This is an alternative to the AY-3-8912 which was used in the CPC range.
